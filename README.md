#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools inorder to develope and maintenan high-quality software systems. It is important in the technology industry as it is used to create software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages - This came after creation of the first computers in 1940s.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s - this is when the waterfall method of software development was introduced.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: In this stage, you gather all the information, documents and user needs that will be essential in the specific software you will be developing.
2. Design: Here, you come up with the sketch or architectural work for your software.
3. Implementation: In this stage, you start developing the software by writing codes based on the requirements and user needs.
4. Testing: This is where you check all codes that you have written and correct mistakes. In this phase, you check whether the software addresses user needs.
5. Deployment: Here, you make the software available to users by either sending it to them or making it public.
6. Maintainance: This is a continous stage as you will keep on providing support and updates for the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- In Waterfall methodology, you use a downward implementation of requirements while developing a software while in Agile methodology, you use interactive approach.
- Example of Waterfall methodology is, you write down user needs and design, and you start coding while following those needs one-by-one in downwards while in Agile methodology you might not use the user list as things might change later and you will have to adjust to the new changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: This person is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: This person is responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing software tests.
plans.
3. Project Manager: He/she is responsible for oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are softwares that provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example Visual Studio and Eclipse.
- Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools which are essensial for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements: This is where requirements change during the development cycle of a software and can lead to project delays. It can be solved by making sure you list all requirements properly before starting developing the software.
2. Tight Deadlines: This is where a developer gets a lot of pressure to deliver software products on schedule which can lead to compromised quality. Proper project management must be done to avoid this challange.
3. Technical Debt: When a developer uses shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, it can cause huge technical debt. Using appropriate software development methodologies can solve this challange.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: This is the testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: This is where you conduct testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: This is where you test the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing of the software is done against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps one to avoid getting confusing or unneccessary answers from AI platform.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Tell me about Africans.
- Tell me more about Africans and where they originated. Include colour of their skin and their general lifestyle.
